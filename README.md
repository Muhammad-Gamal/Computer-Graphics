# Computer-Graphics
To make sure you have implemented yours skills in computers graphics, you must do something different.
In this project we added the joy to work by creating a gaming UI to desktop application by **C#** to practice tasks such as: 
* DDA-Line 
* Bresenham-Line
* Circle
* Ellipse

and other operations on those shapes like: 
* Rotation
* Reflection
* Translation
* Scaling
* Clipping
